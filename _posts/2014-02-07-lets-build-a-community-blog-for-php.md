PHP is being a very popular programming language and it's now more stable than previous. So let's build a community blog where people can share their ideas by writing posts, writing tutorial, guides, learning materials and any other things related to PHP.

Please fork this repo and start writing your post in the markdown format and send us pull request to publish it to this community blog.

Thanks.
